I recently wrote the Coveo for Sitecore 4.1 (Hive) Certification exam and I would like to share my experience!

Coveo for Sitecore is the most advanced search engine for Sitecore. Although Coveo supports both on-premise and cloud indexing, Coveo is moving closer towards the cloud.

The first step is to enrol in the [Coveo for Sitecore Developer Course](https://academy.coveo.com/series/coveo-for-sitecore-administrator-learning-path/coveo-for-sitecore-developer). The course includes one free exam, and any retake costs 500 USD. If you or your employer is a Coveo solutions partner, you may be eligible to take this course for free, including the exam!

To take the most out of the Coveo training experience, I strongly recommend you take the online (pre-recorded) course twice. Make sure you can replicate all the labs without peeking at the solution manual or video.

Overall, the exam was tough. You will have 180 minutes for 90 questions unless you have a Coveo for Sitecore 3.0 Certification. That's 1 question every 2 minutes! The entire exam is comprised of multiple choice questions, but many questions have multiple correct answers and you have to pick all the correct answers. Although you can pause the exam and come back later, you cannot go back to any of the previous questions. Coveo recommends that you do it in one sitting and I recommend the same as well.

During the exam, you will be able to access the internet and any study materials, including the training PDF and the course videos. Make sure you save the PDF downloaded and have it handy at all times so you can search for specific keywords!

I also recommend you prepare a Sitecore installation with the solution from the end of the Coveo training lab. If you don't remember how some part was done during the exam, you can refer back to your Sitecore solution and try it out for yourself.

Finally, have the [Coveo for Sitecore documentation](https://docs.coveo.com/en/2709/root/coveo-for-sitecore-documentation) and [Coveo Cloud control panel](https://www.coveo.com/en/login) open at all times. Searching the documentation and the control panel is crucial for this exam.

Good Luck!
