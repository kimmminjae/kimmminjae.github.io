## How it all started

In 2017, when the price of Bitcoin was 3000 USD and the majority of the world was learning about crypto currency for the first time, I realized that there was a parallel market that was less talked about. The crypto mining market. I was already well aware of mining and all the components that was involved. I remember in 2013 when BTC was at 180 USD and learning to join a mining pool with my graphics card. I didn't have money nor even a high school deploma at that point so after spending bunch of electricity on my under-powered graphics card, I quit. Fast forward to 2017, my friend and I, who were both great with computers and technology as we were both in Bachlor of Computer Engineering, had enough to build a mining rig with 8 AMD Radion RX 570s. We used this as a testing rig, where we found software to flash the BIOS of the graphics cards to optimize for mining Ethereum, developed an internet connected Ardunio board to detect and reset the computer on errors, methods to increase PCI-e capacity for the best CPU to GPU ratio, and finding mining rig components to increase reliability and ROI. After, we were able to find a buyer and made our first profit with notes full of lessons learned.

## Getting our major client

After selling these custom built miners to the market, we learned that we were the only ones building and selling rigs at this scale in our area (Toronto). We decided to take this to a 

## Being hired to assemble a dozen mining rigs

## Client has a large wearhouse in the middle of nowhere? and he wants to do what?

## Hiring employees with knowledge in pc, networking, and teamwork skills
teamwork was the most important aspects.
we can teach them to assemble a few computer components. teamwork isn't a skill taught in a few days.

## Assembly

## Software optimization and a single place to manage
overclocking, mining software, etc.

## Keeping the team spirit up after a long day
party, making the best of being in the middle of nowhere

## Emotions
Many people don't talk about emotions. Yes, we live in a world where objective analyitical data is the name of the game. But after building up this company and being 1 year since created, I wanted to share what I'm feelings.
