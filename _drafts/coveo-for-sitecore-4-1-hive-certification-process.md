I recently wrote the Coveo for Sitecore 4.1 (Hive) Certification exam and I would like to share my experience!

Coveo for Sitecore is the most advanced search engine for Sitecore. It supports on-premise and cloud, where Coveo is moving closer towards cloud.

Tips for the exam:

Enroll in the course:

[https://academy.coveo.com/series/coveo-for-sitecore-administrator-learning-path/coveo-for-sitecore-developer](https://academy.coveo.com/series/coveo-for-sitecore-administrator-learning-path/coveo-for-sitecore-developer "https://academy.coveo.com/series/coveo-for-sitecore-administrator-learning-path/coveo-for-sitecore-developer")

The course includes one free exam. Any Retake is $500 USD (A lot more in Canadian Monopoly Dollars)

Training PDF save it. make sure you can find specific words. open book, open internet. Make use of Control+F. Find keywords in questions to help you find the specific page.

have your sitecore solution open with coveo installed. Test it out on the solution. Will help you remember stuff. preferably an instance with completed labs from the training.

make sure the doc is open. [https://docs.coveo.com/en/2709/root/coveo-for-sitecore-documentation](https://docs.coveo.com/en/2709/root/coveo-for-sitecore-documentation "https://docs.coveo.com/en/2709/root/coveo-for-sitecore-documentation")

Personalization

180 min (3h) for 90 questions unless you have Coveo for Sitecore 3.0 Certification. You will have x questions with y time.

cannot go back to a previous question, but you can pause during the exam by giving your id and pass. They recommend you do it in one sitting. I recommend the same thing as well.

must sign up before doing it

Thanks to [Apiqu](www.apiqu.com "APIQU INC."), a leader in sitecore solutions, I was able to write my exam for free! Check if your employer is a Coveo partner, you may qualify for a free training/exam.
